# Design Work  

This repository is a collection of my AI design projects — agents, prompt frameworks, and experiments in interaction.  
Here you’ll find runnable examples, case studies, and explorations of how AI systems can be shaped to work with people in more thoughtful ways.  

Start with the [WWHW Framework](WWHW_Framework.md) if you’d like to see a complete agent you can run.  
You can also try my [Botanical Garden Tour Guide Agent](tour_guide.md) for a live demonstration of my approach.  

My designs often make use of a setup phase, where the AI begins by asking targeted questions to gather key details before the main interaction. This ensures the assistant has a clear foundation to work from, allowing it to hold coherence across the session while adapting fluidly to user needs. The agent then acts as a living, responsive partner, helping the user in ongoing tasks while evolving with their workflow.
