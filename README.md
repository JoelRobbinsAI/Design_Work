# Design Work  

This repository is a collection of AI design projects — agents, prompt frameworks, and conversation design. Here you’ll find runnable examples, case studies, and explorations of how AI systems can be shaped to work with people in more thoughtful ways.  

Start with the [WWHW Framework](WWHW_Framework.md) if you’d like to see how my prompt methodologies work.

You can also try my [CDFW Hatchery Agent](CDFW-hatchery.md), a python powered, bilingual voice guide, built in collaboration with the California Department of Fish and Wildlife.  

My designs often make use of a setup phase, where the AI begins by asking targeted questions to gather key details before the main interaction. This ensures the assistant has a clear foundation to work from, allowing it to hold coherence across the session while adapting fluidly to user needs. The agent then acts as a living, responsive partner, helping the user in ongoing tasks while evolving with their workflow.
