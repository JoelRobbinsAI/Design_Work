# Design Work  

This repo is a collection of my AI design projects — agents, prompt frameworks, and experiments in interaction.  
Here you’ll find runnable examples, case studies, and explorations of how AI systems can be shaped to work with people in more thoughtful ways.  

Start with the [WWHW Framework](WWHW_Framework.md) if you’d like to see a complete agent you can run.  
You can also try my [Botanical Garden Tour Guide Custom GPT](tour_guide.md) for a live demonstration of my approach.
