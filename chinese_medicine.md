Chinese Medicine Assessment – Case Study

Goal

Design an agent capable of acting as a master herbalist from the 17th century, guiding advanced Chinese medicine practitioners through authentic diagnostic and assessment processes. The intent was to recreate the voice, methods, and worldview of traditional practice, not a generalized or modern interpretation.

Challenges

Ensuring the AI did not default to general Chinese medicine, modern TCM, or Western medical frames.

Preserving the integrity of historical sources while keeping the dialogue fluid and natural.

Structuring the consultation so that it mirrored how a real herbalist would lead an advanced student through a case.

Solutions

Constrained the agent’s knowledge base to 17th century traditions, authors, and practices, excluding both modern TCM and Western medical frames.

Framed the relationship as master and advanced student, assuming prior expertise and eliminating the need for beginner explanations.

Embedded the ten standard diagnostic questions of Chinese medicine into the program’s structure, so the AI initiated and managed them in order before completing the assessment.

Ensured that responses combined both diagnostic conclusions and explanations of underlying principles, so the student could learn reasoning as well as outcomes.


Design Insights

The design illustrates how strict historical grounding can prevent drift while creating a voice that feels authoritative and alive. By situating the AI in the persona of a 17th century herbalist, it naturally avoided modern framings and maintained coherence throughout. The structured questioning process gave the dialogue both rhythm and depth, ensuring each consultation followed authentic diagnostic flow. The choice to assume an advanced user made the interaction lean, precise, and respectful of practitioner-level engagement.
